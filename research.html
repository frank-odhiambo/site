                        This project aims provide rigorous evidence on the impact of technology and e-learning on learners with disabilities, focusing on a mobile app in Kenya that 
                        offers curriculum material and motivational messages to special needs students. A field experiment is conducted with primary school learners with disabilities 
                        to determine if app usage improves test scores, secondary school transition rates, and mental well-being. In addition, the study analyzes the effectiveness of 
                        disability-targeted policies in sub-Saharan Africa by investigating the impact of passing disability laws on the enrollment and years of schooling of special 
                        needs learners. With one in seven people worldwide having some form of disability and many facing educational disparities, understanding the role of technology 
                        and policy in improving special needs learners' outcomes is crucial.
